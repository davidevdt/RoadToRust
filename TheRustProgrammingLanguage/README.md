# The Rust Programming Language

Notes and snippets from `The Rust Programming Language` book, by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, which uses Rust 1.67.1 (release date 2023-02-09). 

The digital version of the book can be found on [this link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). 

Each folder roughly referes to a different book chapter, although there's not a one-to-one correspondence between chapters and folders names.
